==============

**PrepareLanding** is a mod for the [RimWorld](https://rimworldgame.com/) game by [Ludeon studios](https://ludeon.com/blog/). It allows players to carefully choose their landing site before actually starting their colony.

Choosing a landing site can be done by applying and using different set of filters, resulting in a unique combination of tiles, which are then highlighted on the world map.

It is also possible to **change** the current characteristics of a tile for the following features (see [God Mode Tab](god_mode_tab.md)):
* Biome
* Temperature
* Terrain
* Elevation
* Rainfall
* Stone Types
