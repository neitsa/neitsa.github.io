**PrepareLanding** is a mod for the [RimWorld](https://rimworldgame.com/) game by [Ludeon studios](https://ludeon.com/blog/). It allows players to carefully choose their landing site before actually starting their colony.

Choosing a landing site can be done by applying and using different set of filters, resulting in a unique combination of tiles, which are then highlighted on the world map.

* Biome
* Temperature
