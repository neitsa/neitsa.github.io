Choose one of the available biomes, even custom ones from other mods, by clicking the `Select Biome Type` button.

Once a biome is chosen, only tiles from that biomes will be selected.

The vanilla game offers 8 biomes where you can settle (please note that biomes that don't allow bases can't be filtered):

- Arid Shrubland
- Boreal Forest
- Desert
- Extreme Desert
- Ice Sheet
- Sea Ice
- Temperate Forest
- Tropical Rainforest
- Tundra

Please note that the 'Any' biome simply means "All available biomes".

This is the default filter state, which also means that no specific biome filtering is applied in this state (or put in a different way: all biome tiles match)

Terrain Type
------------

Choose one of the available terrain type (even custom ones from other mods), by clicking the `Select Terrain` button.

Once a terrain is chosen, only tiles with that terrain will be selected.

The vanilla game offers 5 terrain types:

- Flat
- Small hills
- Large hills
- Moutainous
- Impassable

Notice that the impassable terrain can't be chosen in `PrepareLanding` as it is not possible to settle you colony in such a terrain.

However the `[TODO]` "Allow impassable tiles" in the Options tab allow you to chose and filter tiles with an impassable terrain.

Road Type
---------

Choose a combination of the available road types by clicking one or more of the multi state options.

The vanilla game offers 5 road types (from the smallest to the biggest):

- Dirt path
- Dirt road
- Stone road
- Ancient asphalt road
- Ancient asphalt highway

See multi-state `[TODO]` option on how to proceed with this type of filter.

The `Reset All` button reset all the road filters to their default state (Partial state).

River Type
----------

Choose a combination of the available river types by clicking one or more of the multi state options.

The vanilla game offers 4 river types (from the biggest to smallest):

- Huge river

See multi-state `[TODO]` option on how to proceed with this type of filter.

The `Reset All` button reset all the road filters to their default state (Partial state).
