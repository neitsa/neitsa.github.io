Once a biome is chosen, only tiles from that biomes will be selected.

The vanilla game offers 8 biomes where you can settle (please note that biomes that don't allow bases can't be filtered):

- Arid Shrubland
- Boreal Forest
- Desert
- Extreme Desert
- Ice Sheet
- Sea Ice
- Temperate Forest
- Tropical Rainforest
- Tundra

Please note that the 'Any' biome simply means "All available biomes". This is the default filter state, which also means that no biome filtering is applied in this state.
