# Activating the Tab

By default the `god mode` tab is not displayed; to be able to see it you need:

1. To be in Developer Mode
2. To activate God Mode

Activating Dev Mode is done by pressing the `Options` button on the Rimworld start screen:

Once this is done, you should see the new `God Mode` tab on the `PrepareLanding` main window.

# Features

As of now, the following features of a tile can be changed:

- Biome
- Average Temperature
- Terrain
- Elevation
- Rainfall
- Stone Types

To change feature simply choose the ones you want to change and finally click on the "Set Tile" Button. If you changed the biome or the elevation, you might want to click the `Redraw Map` button to reflect your change on the world map.

The left part of the window gives you a very detailed information about the temperatures for the chosen tile during the next year (60 days).
